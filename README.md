These scripts should make the Barracuda Managed Workplace UI more usable.

## Scripts

Currently we offer the following scripts:

- **[Clear Warnings via Shortcut](./scripts/clear-warnings-via-shortcut.js):** Hit F2 on the warnings screen to clear a warning and focus the textarea for the notes (nice if you have more warnings than fit on your screen and you need to constantly scroll up to go to the clear button).
